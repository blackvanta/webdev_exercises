    <!-- Exercise instructions:
         1. Write CSS & HTML to create a label + input form component.
            Style the component so that label/input are on the
            right and left of a centered axis:
                    label \ input \ (info)
                    label \ input \ (info)
                    label \ input \ (info)

         2. Implement any design pattern to make each of the components more
         easy to read/use.
         For example: Each label should be bold. Each (info) should be in italics.
         Note: Try creating your own pattern.

         3. For each component, implement one of
         the following CSS patterns:
              a. OOCSS
              b. BEM
              c. SMACSS

         4. Add a required (*) modifier to each of the components.

         5. Compare/contrast each of these implementations. Which one
            do you prefer?
